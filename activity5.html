<p id="top">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈæbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten);
15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India
 from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
 engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
 Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) 
and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
 efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
 ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
 technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the 
original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the People's President,
[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. 
He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest 
civilian.</p>

While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died 
from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands including national-level 
dignitaries attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where he was buried 
with full state honours.[8] 


Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the 
pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State 
of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother 
Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and 
forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four 
brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy traders and 
landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Their business had involved trading 
groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims 
between the mainland and Pamban.</p>
